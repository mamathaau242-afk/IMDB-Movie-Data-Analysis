IMDb Movie Data Analysis

A data analytics project that explores IMDb movie datasets to uncover insights, trends, and predictions in the film industry. 
Using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Power BI, the project demonstrates how raw movie data can be transformed into meaningful visualizations and predictive models.

Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
-Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize formats (dates, currency, text).
-Export cleaned datasets for reuse.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-Analyze IMDb ratings, genres, budgets, revenues, and release year trends.
-Visualize distributions, correlations, and time-based patterns.
Machine Learning Models
-Linear Regression – Predict IMDb ratings and compare actual vs predicted values.
-K-Means Clustering – Group movies with similar characteristics for segmentation.
Interactive Dashboard (Power BI)
-Dynamic filters and visuals for top-rated movies, profitable films, popular genres, and director/actor contributions.
-Visual storytelling tool for both technical and non-technical users.
Unique Feature
-Spoken output using pyttsx3, allowing the system to read results aloud for accessibility and interactivity.

Modeling – Apply Linear Regression and K-Means Clustering.
Visualization – Create static plots in Python and interactive dashboards in Power BI.
Spoken Output – Read insights aloud for accessibility.

Dashboard Highlights

Actor Performance – Bar chart showing actors with highest cumulative ratings.
Top Movies – Titles like 500 Days of Summer and 1-Nenokkadine highlighted.
Runtime Insights – Median runtime (108 minutes) and runtime by genre.
Rating Metrics – Average rating (6.76), min/max ratings by title, ratings by genre.
Director Contributions – Active years and rating impact of directors.

Conclusion

The IMDb Movie Data Analysis project demonstrates how Python and Power BI can be used to transform raw movie data into actionable insights. 
By combining data cleaning, visualization, machine learning, and spoken output, the project bridges the gap between raw data and meaningful storytelling. 
It highlights trends in genres, ratings, directors, and actors while showcasing predictive modeling for future movie success.
